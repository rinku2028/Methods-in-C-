Defining Methods in C#
When you define a method, you basically declare the elements of its structure. The syntax for defining a method in C# is as follows −

<Access Specifier> <Return Type> <Method Name>(Parameter List) {
   Method Body
}
  
  Following are the various elements of a method −

Access Specifier − This determines the visibility of a variable or a method from another class.

Return type − A method may return a value. The return type is the data type of the value the method returns. If the method is not returning any values, then the return type is void.

Method name − Method name is a unique identifier and it is case sensitive. It cannot be same as any other identifier declared in the class.

Parameter list − Enclosed between parentheses, the parameters are used to pass and receive data from a method. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a method. Parameters are optional; that is, a method may contain no parameters.

Method body − This contains the set of instructions needed to complete the required activity.
